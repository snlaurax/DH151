                <p>
                I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science. I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada so life is definitely a change of pace now that I'm in California. I love dogs (though I don't have my own) and travelling. While we're on that topic, I took this picture while I was at UW over Spring Break. My friends and I were exploring Seattle and thought we would make a trip to UW to see the cherry blossoms. I saw the <i> cutest dog </i> there and asked the owner to take a picture with it! Personality wise, I'm normally a pretty loud person so you'll probably hear me before you see me and I find <i> pretty much </i> everything funny. I can normally be found in Sproul Lounge studying, in my room binging a new Kdrama or walking because this campus is huge.

                I'm really excited to be able to work with so many creative and driven people! The group assignments look awesome and I can't wait to hear and see how our ideas will complement and challenge one another. One of my goals in this class is to let my creativity run wild. On a technical level, I want to master some of these topics listed on the syllabus (or at least muster a deep understanding of them!):

                <ul>
                    <li>"How GIS on the internet differs from the desktop experience, and how to prepare spatial information for the web"</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm not even sure what GIS is so I want to learn more about that and how it has been applied to apps we use everyday </li>
                        <li>I'm curious about what it means when it differs on the internet from the desktop experience</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Learn how to use leaflet</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Am I the only one who keeps thinking of leaves and trees when they read this?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Create a GIS project that <b>I'm proud of</b> and research something that I'm <b> <i> passionate </i> </b> about</li>
                </ul>
