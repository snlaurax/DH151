    I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science. I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada so life is definitely a change of pace now that I'm in California. I love dogs (though I don't have my own) and travelling. While we're on that topic, I took this picture while I was at UW over Spring Break. My friends and I were exploring Seattle and thought we would make a trip to UW to see the cherry blossoms. I saw the cutest dog there and asked the owner to take a picture with it! Personality wise, I'm normally a pretty loud person so you'll probably hear me before you see me and I find pretty much everything funny. I can normally be found in Sproul Lounge studying, in my room binging a new Kdrama or walking because this campus is huge.

    I'm really excited to be able to work with so many creative and driven people! The group assignments look awesome and I can't wait to hear and see how our ideas will complement and challenge one another. One of my goals in this class is to create projects that I'm proud of. On a technical level, I want to master GIS.
